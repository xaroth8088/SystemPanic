#System Panic
_A game where anything can happen_

## What is it?

Remember [ROM CHECK FAIL](http://www.farbs.org/romcheckfail.php)?  System Panic is inspired by that, but practically anyone can extend it.

## How do I run it?

There's no packaged versions yet, so you'll need to already have a Python 3.5+ environment set up.  Check out the package and run `SystemPanic/__main__.py`.

## How do I add to it?

If you want to submit a new Pak, take a look at one of the existing Paks, copy it, and start making modifications.
Once you've got something interesting to add to the mix, just open a PR.

Docs will come eventually.

**NOTE**: We absolutely will **NOT** accept Paks with ripped sprites or otherwise unauthorized artwork.  Be sure to update
`README.md` with the credits for your Pak.

## What about changes to the core?

This is still early days, so please file an issue on GitHub with your idea so that we can ensure it meshes well with the
rest of our plans before starting to write new code.  We promise to try to be responsive.  :D

## Dev setup stuff?

1. Python 3.5+
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Profit?

## What's on tap for the future?
* More Paks!
* Code cleanup (this started as weekend hackery, and it shows)
* Performance improvements
* Pre-built binaries to play with
* All the normal game stuff (settings, joystick support, more game states than the main game, etc.)
* Ability to download Paks from arbitrary servers, with appropriate sandboxing
* A central Pak repository, for finding new Paks
* Some built-in shared functionality (such as Box2D physics, etc.) to make common Pak feature developments easier.
* Documentation
* Tests
