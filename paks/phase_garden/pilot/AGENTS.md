# Phase Garden: pilot

Read [this Pak's memory](../AGENTS.md) and [public ABCs](../../../src/system_panic/pak_api.py). `pilot.py` subclasses `PilotBase`. Required: `create(world, position), update(world, dt, control), sprite(world, entity=None)`. Own body stats, raw input edges, ability timers, locomotion and take_damage/on_contact behavior. Jump/orbit/dash state stays here, never in core models.

Load local handles in `init()`; their attribute names are private choices. Instances belong to one run. Use explicit lifecycle callbacks for setup/cleanup. Rendering cannot advance gameplay. The host schedules projectile/effect callbacks once; do not also advance them from the component update. Local helper modules and assets can be copied as partial components. Preserve asset provenance.

on_level_start owns the 15-point between-level heal and 2-second protection; on_shuffle owns 1.5-second protection; on_death owns its burst. demo_controls includes the no-enemies intermission case. No host combat policy supplies these defaults.

Facing refinement: the local pilot sheet is 8 columns × 4 animation poses, selected by this role with zero in-plane rotation or mirroring. Columns follow E/SE/S/SW/W/NW/N/NE. Original built-in imagegen source: assets/images/phase_garden-facing-source.png. The exact input snapshot, prompts and measured lossless extraction are registered in the asset ledgers. Only supported movement facings were generated; controls and physics are unchanged by art selection. Pilot QA emits only eight digital directions and ordinary held/released buttons; live movement keeps the same Controls contract.
